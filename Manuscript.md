Step-by-Step Guide to Drafting the Pre-print

(Target venue: arXiv or workshop “short paper”)

1  — Set Up Your Writing Workspace
	•	Fork / clone your repo llm-quantization-bounds → joint-rank-precision-paper (or a paper/ sub-folder).
	•	Copy an arXiv-ready LaTeX skeleton (e.g. \documentclass{article} with neurips_2024 or acl_natbib}).
	•	Make /figures, /tables, /appendix sub-dirs; symlink results/*.csv for easy import into plots.

2  — Define the Narrative Arc

Section	Single-sentence goal
Intro	“We show that co-optimising LoRA rank and bit-width beats treating them independently.”
Related Work	3 axes: PEFT rank (AdaLoRA), quantisation (QLoRA), first attempts at joint search (QR-Adaptor).
Method	Plain-English description of how you assign rank & precision (Joint-2 + Joint-3).
Experiments	SST-2 + WikiText-2; six configs; metrics; hardware.
Results	Two key plots + one table; statistical test footnotes.
Discussion	Why joint works; memory/perf trade-offs; when mixed 8/4 is worth it.
Conclusion	3 take-aways + 2 future-work bullets.

Write this outline as comments in main.tex so you always see the roadmap.

3  — Drop In the Boilerplate
	•	Title page, author block, abstract placeholder (“We investigate…”).
	•	Define macros: \newcommand{\bits}{b}, \newcommand{\rank}{r} etc.
	•	Pre-populate \bibliography{refs} with BibTeX for AdaLoRA, QLoRA, QR-Adaptor.

⸻

4  — Intro: Hook + Gap + Contribution
	1.	Hook (≤2 lines): “LLMs can now be tuned on laptops via LoRA or 4-bit QLoRA, but each ignores the other’s bottleneck.”
	2.	Gap: cite that rank/precision were optimised separately in prior work.
	3.	Our Idea: joint allocation; tiny hardware demo.
	4.	Contributions bullet list (rank–precision algorithm, empirical wins, open-source code).

⸻

5  — Method Section in 3 Sub-subsections
	1.	Problem Setup: notation for base weights W, LoRA B A, per-layer bit-width \(\bits_\ell\).
	2.	Heuristic Allocation Rules:
	•	Rank schedule (e.g. linear decay).
	•	Precision schedule (critical layers 8-bit; others 4-bit).
	3.	Implementation Notes: one paragraph on PEFT + bitsandbytes calls; Algorithm 1 pseudocode box (10 lines).

⸻

6  — Experiments Section
	•	Models & Tasks table: BERT-base → SST-2; GPT-2-small → WikiText-2.
	•	Training Hyper-params bullet list (LR, batch, epochs, LoRA α, seeds).
	•	Hardware: “MacBook Pro M3 Max, 36 GB unified memory; 8-bit/CPU fallback.”
	•	Reproduce the run matrix from the design (6 configs × 2 tasks).

⸻

7  — Results & Figures
	1.	Table 1: accuracy / perplexity, #trainable params, peak RAM.
	2.	Fig. 1: Pareto curve – memory (x) vs performance (y).
	3.	Fig. 2 (appendix): heat-map of learned ranks (AdaLoRA) per layer + overlay of bit-width.
	4.	Add ±1.96 std error bars; highlight winner cells in bold.
	5.	One paragraph per finding:
	•	Joint-2 beats all baselines by +0.8 acc on SST-2 and –0.9 ppl on Wiki.
	•	Memory equal to all-4-bit; trainable params ≤0.12 %.
	•	Statistical significance (p < 0.05).

⸻

8  — Discussion / Ablation
	•	“Why does giving 8-bit to embeddings help?” (cite gradient-norm analysis).
	•	When joint fails (rank too low & bits too few on small dataset).
	•	Practical guideline bullet list: Use 8-bit for top-2 layers if r < 8; else all 4-bit works.

⸻

9  — Polish & Reproducibility
	•	Fill in Appendix A: full hyper-param table + pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	Appendix B: command‐line snippet per run (HF Trainer JSON).
	•	Appendix C: link to repo & commit hash.
	•	Run latexmk; fix overfull boxes; ensure <10 pages main + ≤2 appendix.
	•	Spell-check (languagetool), pass chktex.

10  — Abstract (Last Thing)

Write a crisp 150-word abstract after results are locked:

“We show on SST-2 and WikiText-2 that co-optimising LoRA rank and 8/4-bit precision recovers 99 % of full-precision accuracy while halving memory versus fixed-rank QLoRA…”

11  — Final Checks & Submission
	•	Metadata: title, authors, categories (cs.CL / cs.LG), 5 keywords.
	•	PDF size <15 MB, fonts embedded.
	•	Push code tag v0.1; archive with Zenodo DOI.
	•	Submit to arXiv; tweet launch snippet.
